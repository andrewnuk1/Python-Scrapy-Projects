# Python-Scrapy-Projects

A home for samples of the Scrapy code i am working on

They all follow the normal scrapy folder convention Projectname / Projectname / spiders
The second folder contains items.py, pipelines.py an settings.py (these are almost all standard and so not included here)
The spiders folder contains the programs i have included in this repository
The items.py files can be deduced from the spiders files
